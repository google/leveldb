// A sample program demonstrating using Google C++ testing framework.

// This sample shows how to write a more complex unit test for a class
// that has multiple member functions.
//
// Usually, it's a good idea to have one test for each method in your
// class.  You don't have to do that exactly, but it helps to keep
// your tests organized.  You may also throw in additional tests as
// needed.

// In this example, we test the MyString class (a simple string).

// Tests the default c'tor.
TEST(MyString, DefaultConstructor) {
  const MyString s;

  // Asserts that s.c_string() returns NULL.
  //
  // <TechnicalDetails>
  //
  // If we write NULL instead of
  //
  //   static_cast<const char *>(NULL)
  //
  // in this assertion, it will generate a warning on gcc 3.4.  The
  // reason is that EXPECT_EQ needs to know the types of its
  // arguments in order to print them when it fails.  Since NULL is
  // #defined as 0, the compiler will use the formatter function for
  // int to print it.  However, gcc thinks that NULL should be used as
  // a pointer, not an int, and therefore complains.
  //
  // The root of the problem is C++'s lack of distinction between the
  // integer number 0 and the null pointer constant.  Unfortunately,
  // we have to live with this fact.
  //
  // </TechnicalDetails>
