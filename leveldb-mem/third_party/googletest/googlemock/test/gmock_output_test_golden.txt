FILE:#: ERROR: this mock object should be deleted but never is. Its address is @0x#.
ERROR: 3 leaked mock objects found at program exit. Expectations on a mock object is verified when the object is destructed. Leaking a mock means that its expectations aren't verified, which is usually a test bug. If you really intend to leak a mock, you can suppress this error using testing::Mock::AllowLeak(mock_object), or you may use a fake or stub instead of a mock.
