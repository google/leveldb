  // Parameters that affect behavior

  // Comparator used to define the order of keys in the table.
  // Default: a comparator that uses lexicographic byte-wise ordering
  //
  // REQUIRES: The client must ensure that the comparator supplied
  // here has the same name and orders keys *exactly* the same as the
  // comparator provided to previous open calls on the same DB.

  // If true, an error is raised if the database already exists.
  bool error_if_exists = false;

  // If true, the implementation will do aggressive checking of the
  // data it is processing and will stop early if it detects any
  // errors.  This may have unforeseen ramifications: for example, a
  // corruption of one DB entry may cause a large number of entries to
  // become unreadable or for the entire DB to become unopenable.
  bool paranoid_checks = false;

  // Use the specified object to interact with the environment,
  // e.g. to read/write files, schedule background work, etc.
  // Default: Env::Default()

  // -------------------
  // Parameters that affect performance

  // Amount of data to build up in memory (backed by an unsorted log
  // on disk) before converting to a sorted on-disk file.
  //
  // Larger values increase performance, especially during bulk loads.
  // Up to two write buffers may be held in memory at the same time,
  // so you may wish to adjust this parameter to control memory usage.
  // Also, a larger write buffer will result in a longer recovery time
  // the next time the database is opened.
  size_t write_buffer_size = 4 * 1024 * 1024;

  // increase this if your database has a large working set (budget
  // one open file per 2MB of working set).

  // Control over blocks (user data is stored in a set of blocks, and
  // a block is the unit of reading from disk).

  // If null, leveldb will automatically create and use an 8MB internal cache.
  Cache* block_cache = nullptr;

  // Approximate size of user data packed per block.  Note that the

  // actual size of the unit read from disk may be smaller if
  // compression is enabled.  This parameter can be changed dynamically.

  // leave this parameter alone.

  // Leveldb will write up to this amount of bytes to a file before
  // switching to a new one.
  // Most clients should leave this parameter alone.  However if your
  // filesystem is more efficient with larger files, you could
  // consider increasing the value.  The downside will be longer
  // compactions and hence longer latency/performance hiccups.
  // Another reason to increase this parameter might be when you are
  // initially populating a large database.

  // Compress blocks using the specified compression algorithm.  This
  // parameter can be changed dynamically.
  //
  // Default: kSnappyCompression, which gives lightweight but fast
  // compression.
  //
  // Typical speeds of kSnappyCompression on an Intel(R) Core(TM)2 2.4GHz:
  //    ~200-500MB/s compression
  //    ~400-800MB/s decompression
  // Note that these speeds are significantly faster than most
  // persistent storage speeds, and therefore it is typically never
  // worth switching to kNoCompression.  Even if the input data is
  // incompressible, the kSnappyCompression implementation will
  // efficiently detect that and will switch to uncompressed mode.

  // If this flag is false, and the machine crashes, some recent
  // writes may be lost.  Note that if it is just the process that
  // crashes (i.e., the machine does not reboot), no writes will be
  // lost even if sync==false.
  //
  // In other words, a DB write with sync==false has similar
