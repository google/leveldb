# Contributing

We'd love to accept your code patches! However, before we can take them, we
have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

## Contributor License Agreements

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License
Agreement as appropriate.

* If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
own the intellectual property, then sign an [individual CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).
* If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
then sign a [corporate CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it.

## Submitting a Patch

1. Sign the contributors license agreement above.
2. Decide which code you want to submit. A submission should be a set of changes
that addresses one issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/google/leveldb/issues).
Please don't mix more than one logical change per submission, because it makes
the history hard to follow. If you want to make a change
(e.g. add a sample or feature) that doesn't have a corresponding issue in the
issue tracker, please create one.
3. **Submitting**: When you are ready to submit, send us a Pull Request. Be
sure to include the issue number you fixed and the name you used to sign
the CLA.

## Writing Code ##

If your contribution contains code, please make sure that it follows
[the style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
Otherwise we will have to ask you to make changes, and that's no fun for anyone.
